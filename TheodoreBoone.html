  <div class="character-descriptions">
    <p><strong>Theodore Boone:</strong> A thirteen-year old boy who dreams of being a lawyer one day. He loves Government class at his school with Mr. Mount, and he enjoys playing golf with his father.</p>
    <p><strong>Marcella Boone:</strong> Theo's mother. She is a divorce lawyer working on her own firm, Boone & Boone along with Woods Boone.</p>
    <p><strong>Woods Boone:</strong> Theo's father. He is a real estate lawyer who has always worked in his office. He was considered a slob at the Boone & Boone firm because of his untidiness in his office.</p>
    <p><strong>April Finnemore:</strong> Theo's best friend. April had gone through some rough times. Both parents filed for divorce, and she had to choose which one she was going to live with. Most likely, she was going to stay with her mother, even though she didn't want to live with anyone in her family.</p>
    <p><strong>Ike Boone:</strong> Theo's uncle. Ike was a former lawyer who started the Boone & Boone Firm. He was a tax lawyer who was disbarred after he did something wrong.</p>
    <p><strong>Julio Pena:</strong> Theo's friend from school. He had been living in a homeless shelter with his family, from El Salvador. Theo helped him with his English and Algebra occasionally. His cousin was a witness in the murder trial that was ongoing, so he asked Theo for help and advice on what to do.</p>
    <p><strong>Bobby Escobar:</strong> Julio's cousin. Bobby worked at the Waverly Creek golf course, where he witnessed a man go into the house of Mr. and Mrs. Duffy and coming back out 10 minutes later. Although he couldn’t go to the police because he was an illegal immigrant, he was worried he would be arrested and shipped back to El Salvador.</p>
    <p><strong>Judge Gantry:</strong> A highly respected judge in Strattenburg and the presiding judge of the Duffy murder trial. He quite frankly adored Theo and will always do anything for him.</p>
    <p><strong>Peter Duffy:</strong> A wealthy man who lived in Waverly Creek. He was the husband of Myra Duffy and was suspected of killing her. Duffy was big on golfing, and he would golf every day at the same time.</p>
